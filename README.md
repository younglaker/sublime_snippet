## Description

Sublime snippets, you can download and paste it into your "Sublime Text 2/Packages/" file, it will works. Also, you can edit and delete whatever you want.

The reason I write these snippets is Zen conding support very well in html, but not css and js, especially jquery. Also original snippets in sublime are not suit for my code style. I have to say, these snippets are based on my code style. Also, you have to give up some other sublime snippets to avoid conflict.

You can read the [doc](doc.md "doc") here. Please post the issues you found or create a branch to help me to improve.

Enjoy~
